> Roma is a command line tool writen in Rust to convert a CSV file to SQL insert statements. It has special features like grouping insert statements in transaction chunks and inserting multiple rows with a single insert statement.

== Why Roma

Using cloud providers to run our business has been a game changer. They allow us to rapidly provision all the resources to ensure high availability, security, and performance. In many cases, They also manage resources for us, considerably reducing complexity and saving time. However, the more control we delegate to them the less autonomy we have over those resources. This is a good thing because it pushes towards the adoption of good practices, but it can also be challenging sometimes.

Take the provision of a managed PostgreSQL Server on Azure, for example. Azure ensures it is optimally configured for our needs, but it is quite limited when it comes to seeding the database using a CSV file. This is relatively easy doing with direct access to the server, but not possible to do in a managed instance.

To solve this problem to all platforms, all cloud providers, and all SQL databases, we have developed a simple tool capable of converting a CSV file into a SQL file, where records turn into insert statements. All you need after using Roma is a mean to execute the final SQL script.

== Using Rome

    $ ./roma --csv waterloo_tree_inventory.csv

This is what happened by default:

- the name of the CSV file is used as the name of the table in the insert statement
- the first line is skipped because it contains the headers that describe the data
- the headers in the first line are used as columns of the table
- the column separator is comma
- each line in the CSV turns into an insert statement
- if the value contains at least one alphanumeric character then it is quoted.
- if the value contains a valid number then it is not quoted.

These default behaviours can be changed using arguments. For example, to set a table name different from the CSV file name, use:

    $ ./roma --csv waterloo_tree_inventory.csv --table TREE_INVENTORY

If the first line contains data instead of headers then indicate it using:

    --labels false

If the labels are not present in the file or they don't match the columns of the table then we can customize the columns passing multiple `--column` or `-c` arguments, one of each column:

    --column "coord_x(number)" --column "coord_y(number)" --column "street(text)" --column "species(text)" ...

Note that this argument is required if `--label` is `false`. 

The supported column types are **number**, **text**, and **date**. They are simple because they just define whether the value is sourounded by single cotes or not, or whether dates have to be formatted according to database requirements.

If the file is using the _tab_ character as value separator, then specify it this way:

    --separator tab

Sometimes the CSV file is too large and generates too many insert statements to the point a single database transaction cannot cope. To create several thransactions throughout the file, use:

    --chunk 1000

It puts chunks of 1000 inserts between `begin transaction` and `commit transaction`. The insert statements can be further optimized, inserting several records at once by using:

    --chunkinsert 250

A proper configuration of `--chunk` and `chunkinsert` can optimize the SQL file maximum performance. In this case, a CSV file with 10000 records would be converted into a SQL with 10 transactions and each transaction would contain 4 inserts with 250 records each.
